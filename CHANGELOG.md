## 3.18.0 (2025-06-09)

## 3.15.0 (2025-06-03)


- fix: Changed the copy function in taigaclient cli
- Previously it used to skip files that doesn't have any "underlying_file_id" in the metadata. However, the newly updated file doesn't have that field resulting in the latest file in the dataset not getting copied when the copy command was being used. This commit fixes that.

## 3.13.0 (2025-02-27)


- feat: Added a copy feature to taigaclient cli (#27)

## 3.12.0 (2025-01-22)


- feat: forcing package deploy attempt

## 3.11.0 (2025-01-21)


- feat: Added get_latest_version_id method
- Used for looking up the latest version for a given taiga dataset permaname

## 3.10.0 (2025-01-06)


- feat: get_datafile_metadata now returns original_file_sha256
- get_datafile_metadata() returns instances of MinDataFileMetadata which
now have a field named `original_file_sha256`. This hash is the sha256 hash
of the file that was originally uploaded to Taiga and is useful for checking to
see whether a file in Taiga is the same as one you have locally. (For example,
checking before uploading a file. If the file is the same, no need to upload.)

## 3.9.1 (2024-11-20)


- fix: Pull from master to get latest version before publishing

## 3.9.0 (2024-10-21)


- feat: Accumulated changes not yet published to repo

## 3.8.5 (2024-07-25)


- fix: still trying to figure out updating version

## 3.8.4 (2024-07-25)


- fix: Dummy commit in order to bump version
- chore: Removed constraint preventing pandas > 2

## 3.8.3 (2024-04-11)


- chore: Update commitizen hook version
- build: Add commitizen hook pre-merge-commit
- build: Add commitizen
- Test commit for Github Actions

## [3.3.5] - 2023-04-14
### Added
- Added "custom_metadata" dictionary support to creating, updating, and downloading datasets

## [3.3.4] - 2022-06-09

### Fixed
- Fixed bug where getting the DataFrame for a datafile failed after downloading the raw file

## [3.2.4] - 2021-03-22

### Fixed
- Fixed bug where getting the DataFrame for a datafile failed after downloading the raw file

## [3.2.3] - 2021-02-26

### Fixed
- Fixed typos in `taigaclient` that were preventing downloading files

## [3.2.2] - 2021-02-18

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where `TaigaClient.get` cached files under the wrong key when only `name` was supplied

## [3.2.1] - 2021-02-01

### Fixed
- Fixed uploading using Jupyter Notebooks

## [3.2.0] - 2021-01-29

### Added

## [3.1.0] - 2021-01-28

### Changed
- When updating a dataset, local files to be uploaded are checked against the base dataset version. If they have the same content (based on SHA256 and MD5 hashes) and [type](./Definitions.md#DataFile_Type)/[format](./Definitions.md#DataFile_Formats) of a datafile in the base dataset version, the local file will not be uploaded, and instead a virtual file will be created based on the existing datafile.

### Fixed
- Removed checking for column types existing (endpoint now returns None)

## [3.0.5] - 2021-01-27

### Fixed
- Add warning when downloading a file whose underlying file is in a deprecated or deleted dataset

## [3.0.4] - 2021-01-26

### Fixed
- Use `low_memory_mode=False`

## [3.0.3] - 2021-01-26

### Fixed
- Lower version of pyarrow

## [3.0.2] - 2021-01-26

### Fixed
- Pin version of pyarrow

## [3.0.1] - 2021-01-21

### Fixed
- Fixed removing deleted datasets from the cache
- Fixed getting canonical Taiga IDs for short IDs referencing virtual datafiles

## [3.0.0] - 2021-01-21

### Added

- Ability to provide a map of Taiga IDs to Figshare download links to download files directly from Figshare.

### Changed

- `TaigaClient.download_to_cache` no longer supports a `format` parameter. The format of the file downloaded is now determined by the [datafile type](docs/Definitions.md#DataFile_Type) (CSV for "HDF5" and "Columnar" type, plaintext for "Raw" type).
- Creating and updating a dataset have new formats for the `upload_file` parameter. See [the API documentation](docs/TaigaClient%20API.md#taigapytaigaclientcreatedataset) for more details.
- Some no longer raise exceptions, and instead print an error message and return `None`. These include:
    - Attempting to fetch something from a deleted dataset
    - Attempting to fetch a Raw file
- Uploading files now occurs concurrently.

### Removed
- The `force` parameter is no longer available for various `TaigaClient` functions.
- UUID (ex: “dafc620dd7824a71a4b3ed42e4995d4e”) is no longer be a supported format for datasets, dataset versions, and datafiles (some may still work, but we won’t guarantee these anymore)
- `TaigaClient` no longer reads from raw CSVs in the Taiga cache

## [2.12.13] - 2020-05-13

### Fixed

- Actually fix deletion of corrupted virtual files from cache.
- Actually fix deletion of interrupted virtual file downloads from cache.

## [2.12.12] - 2020-04-29

### Fixed

- Fix deletion of corrupted virtual files from cache.
- Fix deletion of interrupted virtual file downloads from cache.

## [2.12.11] - 2020-02-13

### Added

- Add `TaigaClient.get_canonical_id` function, which gets the full (`dataset_permaname.dataset_version/datafile_name`) ID of the real (not virtual) datafile

## [2.12.10] - 2020-02-03

### Added
- Retrying `TaigaClient.get` when local HDF5 file is corrupted.
- Deleting file from cache if `TaigaClient.get` is interrupted by the user.

## [2.12.9] - 2020-01-24

### Fixed

- Set minimum version of progressbar

## [2.12.8] - 2019-11-06

### Fixed

- Fixed typo in updating a dataset with all files from previous version

## [2.12.7] - 2019-10-30

### Added

- New `TaigaClient.upload_dataset argument` `add_all_existing_files` which specifies whether to add existing files in the original dataset to the new dataset version as virtual files.
- New `TaigaClient.upload_dataset argument` `changes_description` which specifies the description of changes for the new dataset version.

## [2.12.6] - 2019-10-23

### Added

- `TaigaClient` keeps mapping of virtual datafiles to their underlying datafile, so `.get` and `.download_to_cache` will use the underlying file if it is in the cache, and no longer fetch the file Taiga.
- Matrix (HDF5) files are now downloaded as `.hdf5` for `TaigaClient.get` and taigaclient fetch, which avoids file conversions for unconverted files

## [2.12.5] - 2019-10-15

### Fixed

- Fix default for `TaigaClient.update_dataset` `upload_file_path_dict` argument

## [2.12.4] - 2019-10-15

### Fixed
- `TaigaClient.update_dataset` now allows updating a dataset with only virtual datafiles

## [2.12.3] - 2019-10-10

### Changed

- Use column type inference from pandas instead of Taiga

## [2.12.2] - 2019-10-03

### Added

- `taigaclient` dataset-meta command supports `--version-id`.

### Changed
- `taigaclient` handles and reports exceptions, rather than just printing them to console.
- Columnar datafile column type inference updated to use information from Taiga.


## [2.12.1] - 2019-10-03

### Changed
- `TaigaClient.get` supports datafile ID arguments in the form of `dataset_name.dataset_version` (previously raised exception)


## [2.12.0] - 2019-09-27

### Added

- `TaigaClient` offline mode, which uses files in the cache without validation when not connected to Taiga

## [2.11.0] - 2019-09-26

### Added

- `taigaclient` command line tool

### Changed

- `TaigaClient`'s cache uses feather format instead of pickling
